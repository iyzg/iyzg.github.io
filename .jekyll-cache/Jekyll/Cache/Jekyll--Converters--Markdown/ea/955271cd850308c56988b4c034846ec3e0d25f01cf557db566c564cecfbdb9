<p>I know what youâ€™re thinking, â€œWhat could a guy that has only done one contest
possibly know about contest prep?â€ Although I may not have a lot of experience
in CF contests, I have experience preparing for contests and high intensity so
Iâ€™d like to act as if I have some tips. So without further ado, here are my
contest prep tips!</p>

<h2 id="practice">Practice.</h2>
<p>Thereâ€™s no other prep thatâ€™s as effective as practice.  Thereâ€™s a direct
correlation between deliberate practice (post on that <a href="/blog/2019/11/10/the-start">here</a> c;) and rating. To prove that, Iâ€™ve included a very
real, accurate graph to illustrate the relationship.</p>

<p>All jokes, practice truly is the most important part of prep and comes before
anything else here.</p>

<h2 id="the-e-word">The E Word</h2>
<p>Thatâ€™s right, Iâ€™m about to try and argue to fellow nerds that anerobic exercise
is important to your performance. To try and prove this to you, Iâ€™ll use chess
as an example, as both chess and CP require long periods of mental exertion and
complex problem solving. If you take a look at the top players in chess, youâ€™ll
notice two things: theyâ€™re alright at chess and theyâ€™re fit. Letâ€™s take a look
at Fabiano Caruana (#2 as of the time of writing) as an example. According to
him, he runs, plays basketball, and swims. All of these <strong>aerobic</strong> exercises
help him destress while boosting his confidence and stamina. Now for the more
observant readers, youâ€™ll be quick to point out that Caruana is <em>only</em> #2 in the
world. So if exercise gives such a huge boost to performance, why isnâ€™t he #1?
Because Magnus Carlsen (#1 as of writing) also is a huge exercise proponent. He
has said that staying in great shape through playing soccer and yoga is just as
important as chess practice. While competitive programming doesnâ€™t demand the
same level of endurance as chess does, /* Wrap up this section */</p>

<p>The beauty is that you donâ€™t need to be a
marathon runner to reap the benefits of exercise, even just 15 minutes is
enough. As long as you get your heart working, youâ€™re doing fine.</p>

<h2 id="the-w-word">The W Word</h2>
<p>As obvious as it might seem, being hydrated is essential to strong performance
during  Iâ€™m done with the dumb â€œX Wordâ€ headings now. As obvious as it might
seem, water is very important to staying at peak performance. Itâ€™s
scientifically proven that when your brain is hydrated <strong>Do some research
iinto how water affects performance</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-ritual">The Ritual</h2>
<p>Rituals hold an important place in everyoneâ€™s lives as they provide cues.</p>

<p>Once again, thanks for reading! I hope that you implement one of these into your
practice (unless you already do all of them, weird flex) and enjoyed the blog.</p>
