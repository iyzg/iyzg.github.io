<p>Hello everybody. I hope you all enjoyed a nice Thanksgiving this year and
took advantage of your holiday break! This week I’ll be talking about
reflection, how mindset affects performance, and my training refinements.</p>

<h2 id="the-limit-of-reflection">The Limit of Reflection</h2>
<p>For anyone who’s been following my performance lately, it hasn’t been too hot.
The problems I missed during the last contest were ones that were within my
solving abilities, but I failed to solve them when it mattered most. Now a
normal person here would be like, “I’m sure it’s just nerves or luck, so I’ll
just enjoy my holiday break with my family”. At least that’s what I’m assuming.
But no, no, no, me from 4 days in the past decided that there was a better
alternative to time off.  Instead, I’d do 1-2 Virtual Contests every day and
figure out if it was truly nerves or bad luck causing poor performance. TL;DR
No.</p>

<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>
<p>So far, so good or at least no so bad. I only solved AB of a Div3 because I
forgot to return 0 after printing a solution in C which led to 90 minutes of
frustration. Estimated rating delta of -60, but it can only go up from here right?</p>

<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>
<p>Hey lets go, only a -1 delta and this time I solved ABC so clearly without too
much trouble. That <strong>MUST</strong> mean that the first virtual contest performance was
just bad luck.</p>

<h3 id="days-3-4--5">Days 3, 4, &amp; 5</h3>
<p>Someone please send help.</p>

<p>At the end of the 5 days of contests, I had a wall of negative deltas in my
spreadsheet and a deflated ego.</p>

<p>Time and time again, I was getting slow solves on easy problems and failing to
solve tougher problems. The reflections I wrote after each contest seemed to
place my failure on just about every aspect of my abilities you could imagine,
yet the underlying cause still eluded me [Maybe place some smart as if ]. That
is until help came in the form of a CodeForces message. One of my readers who
I’ll call VwbJmvY (I’ve encrypted his name for privacy), reached out and said
he’d be willing to help me on my quest to achieve world domination along with
2000 CF in a year. It took him 10 minutes to figure out what I couldn’t figure
out in 5 days: I needed to slow down and work through problems before
implementation. In retrospect, it seems glaringly obvious that attempting to
think through the problem while implementing, for me personally, was leading
to wrong ideas along with a lot of wasted time trying to implement those bad
ideas; but without a second pair of eyes, I might never have found this error.
I’ve learned it’s really important to get help and a fresh perspective when
you’re stuck on a problem that you <strong>really can’t figure out.</strong> Emphasis on the
bold part of that sentence.  It’s always important that you attempt to solve
problems by yourself and only ask for help when you’ve truly ran out of ideas.
Without investing the upfront cost of trying to solve the problem yourself, the
return you get will be severly diminished. After this one simple change in how I
approach problems during contests, my next virtual contest also became first postive
delta.</p>

<h2 id="mindset">Mindset</h2>
<p>My new mentor, VwbJmvY, has also helped me change the way I think during
contests and my view on success. During the first two contests I partook in,
rating was at the forefront of my mind. This led to a lot of rushed and half
thought out attempts to try and submit as fast as possible. Not only did this
serve me more penalties, the nervousness also rendered me incapable of working 
through the tougher problems. Combine these two factors together and you get a
Plasma that is a brick. Doing all these practice contests also shattered my
assumption that latter problems are always harder than earlier problems. Seeing
as we all have areas where we’re stronger in, this doesn’t always hold true.
Just taking a quick read of the next problem could and realizing it’s easier for
you could make the difference between a positive and negative delta.</p>

<p>Thanks again for reading! If you have any feedback on the more casual tone or
direction I’m taking the blog, I’d love to hear it :) I hope you guys
enjoyed this week’s post and learned something new. See you again next week!</p>
