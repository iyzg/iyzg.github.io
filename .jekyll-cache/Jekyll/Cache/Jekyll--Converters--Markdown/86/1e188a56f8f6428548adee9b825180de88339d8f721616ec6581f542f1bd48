I"ñ<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Merry Christmas you filthy animal: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b5rhORoiHC28DbsmAn4jQpWyH5K1DO8xU8IhhnRAAAg/edit?usp=sharing">What you came for!</a></p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Do you ever feel like you don‚Äôt know what problems to solve? Are you
solving problems but feeling like you aren‚Äôt making progress? Do you have 
troubles holding a coherent conversation when faced with the daunting
task of conversing with the fairer sex? Although the magic spreadsheet 
doesn‚Äôt have the answer to that last question (maybe it does, surprise
me), it can help you with the first two. So sit back and strap in, as I
give some tips on how to get the most mileage out of the my practice 
spreadsheet!</p>

<h2 id="timing">Timing</h2>
<p>Marking down attempts is like food, you have to get at it while it‚Äôs still warm but not burning hot.
If there‚Äôs a problem you end up checking the TCs or editorial for during a practice session, 
wait until the end of the session to add it to your list. This helps you stay focused for the rest of your 
practice, and also relieves you the stress of trying to write a good reflection while solving. Be sure not 
to leave it for too long though, or you‚Äôll forget what sections of the problem caused you the most trouble.</p>

<h2 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</h2>
<p>If you notice at the top of the ‚ÄúAttempts‚Äù page, there are three color statuses: Completely Solved (blue), Solved Once
(green), and In Cycle (yellow). In cycle just means that you needed external help to solve the problem, so they‚Äôre now
in your spaced repetition problem bank. 3/4 weeks after solving the problem with help, go back and try solving the 
problem once more. The timing is key here to make sure you don‚Äôt just have the problem memorized and are actually solving
it from scratch again. If you successfully solve it for the second time,  move the problem up to the green level. Although
reflection for the second time isn‚Äôt necessary, it‚Äôs always nice to look back on what this problem has taught you. Finally after
another period of time, give the problem one last solve before retiring it to the Completely Solved tier. By going through the 
arduous process of solving a problem three times, you make sure there aren‚Äôt any holes in your skill set that you forget about.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve finally arrived at our main ingredient. Although every component of the spreadsheet is important,
reflection is by far the most crucial. Remember that content far outweighs your writing style so don‚Äôt feel pressured to write
 MLA double spaced essays for each one. But Ivy, what‚Äôs important
to write about in a reflection? Well, I‚Äôm glad you asked. The three main points your reflection should 100% cover are:
your thinking process, technique missed, and keywords/patterns, but let‚Äôs go a bit more in depth. For thinking process,
be sure to note what other solutions you thought about, what led you to that faulty idea, and why it didn‚Äôt work. A bare-bone example 
might be, ‚ÄúTried to brute force which didn‚Äôt work because of large constraints and tight TL‚Äù. It‚Äôs also key to identify
keywords/patterns that lead to the correct technique; like how maximum/minimum/count often lead to DP solutions. By finding
which topics you struggle with the most, your weaknesses become clearer and help you select future problems.</p>

<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>
<p>I want to thank you guys for all the support I‚Äôve gotten this year, and I can‚Äôt wait for what next year brings. If you 
have any suggestions for the blog/spreadsheet, I‚Äôm always open to ideas! Until next year, Fake LGM Ivy signing off.</p>
